# About

## General

Welcome to my website!

My name is Will. I am a chemical and computer engineering graduate from
[Montana State University](https://www.montana.edu/). Most of my projects are
on [Sourcehut](https://git.sr.ht/~learax/), although not a lot of them are
public at the moment; I also maintain mirrors on
[GitHub](https://github.com/w-culhane).

I have lived in the following places:

- Atlanta, GA
- Billings, MT
- Boise, ID
- Bozeman, MT
- Austin, TX
